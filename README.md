All file names are unaltered from their raw versions, the only extra inclusions are the folders. No duplicates are present, and any file that could have fit two categories was sorted into the most suitable folder.

Feel free to give feedback on the sorting and where files should be moved if necessary. 

If you'd like to find where the sounds play in-game:
- Install devtools, Warp mod, and Beastmaster to navigate to the room or spawn the entity you'd like to find sounds for.
- For regular sound effects, press O (activate devtools), I (show sound effect log), and U (reload sounds) to see a log of the sound effects currently playing.
- For ambient sound effects, press O (activate devtools) and H (open room information) and click on "Sounds" to see sound objects placed in the room you're in.

If you do not have access to mods or cannot make this work, feel free to message me on discord (@cookiecaker) to find it.
